        <section aria-label="Summary">
            <p class="lead">
                30+ years of audacious turnarounds, market-shaping telematics, and people-first leadership deserved more
                than a farewell speech, so the client asked us to turn Vipen Malhotra's career into an heirloom
                coffee-table book. Working against a ceremony-locked deadline, our writers, designers, and print
                engineers sifted thousands of photos, project memos, and personal anecdotes to produce a 120-page volume
                that feels as intimate as a family album yet as authoritative as an annual report. It honours the impact
                he's had on organisations and on lives, capturing the perseverance, innovation, and empathy colleagues
                credit for their own growth.
            </p>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <div class="prose">
                <p>
                    The goal was to capture the man behind the milestones. Vipen's story wasn't just about business
                    wins; it was about the lives he touched, the jobs he saved, and the empathy that defined his
                    leadership style. We truly wanted the readers, including his colleagues, friends, and family, to
                    feel his journey of pioneering India's telematics frontier.

        <section class="section" aria-label="Our process">
            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <div class="process">
                <p>Working against a ceremony-locked deadline, our team of writers, designers, and print engineers:</p>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Sifted through thousands of archival photographs and internal project notes</li>
                    <li>Conducted interviews with long-time colleagues and executives</li>
                    <li>Crafted a narrative arc that blended corporate history with emotional storytelling</li>
                    <li>Designed each spread to mirror Vipen's leadership values - precision, empathy, and integrity
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The book was printed on imported matte stock with a linen hard-case jacket and metallic embossing - a
                    tactile representation of the legacy it carried.</p>

        <section class="section" aria-label="The story we told">
            <h2>The Story We Told</h2>
            <div class="prose">
                <h3>Reviving Businesses from the Brink</h3>
                <p>Initially sent to shut down operations, Vipen defied the odds. Transforming a “closure” order into a
                    comeback story. Through rebranding, workforce revival, and strategic repositioning, he protected
                    thousands of jobs and restored faith.</p>

                <h3>Scaling India’s Telematics Frontier</h3>
                <p>At the telecom company, Vipen spearheaded the rollout of 100,000+ GPS units - powering employee
                    transport, public safety, and hazardous-material tracking across India. His foresight positioned the
                    company at the cutting edge of smart mobility.</p>

                <h3>Revolutionising Fleet & Radio Services</h3>
                <p>From fleet management to mission-critical communication systems, Vipen guided bold integrations and
                    expansions - shaping it into a national leader in intelligent transport solutions.</p>

                <h3>Smart City and Toll Solutions</h3>
                <p>Under his leadership, high-impact projects like the smart-city transport and toll management across
                    750 lanes were executed, advancing India’s infrastructure while enhancing public efficiency and
                    safety.</p>

                <h3>Leadership with a Human Core</h3>
                <p>Beyond technology and revenue, Vipen built a culture of compassion. He made personal sacrifices
                    during financial downturns, championed employee training, and even helped save a colleague's
                    spouse's life by arranging urgent medical care.</p>

                <h3>Words from the Successor</h3>
                <p>"Your guidance has been instrumental in my understanding of Arya Omnitalk and Syntel. Though stepping
                    into your shoes after thirty years of exemplary service is daunting, I am determined to give my
                    best."</p>

                    than a retirement gift. It became a company heirloom. A tangible narrative that immortalises Vipen
                    Malhotra's philosophy:</p>
                <p class="result-quote">"True leadership is not about titles or positions; it's about the impact you
                    make, the lives you touch, and the legacy you leave behind."</p>
